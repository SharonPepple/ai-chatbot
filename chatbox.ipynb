potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening\\n\\nHeart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease\\n\\nWeak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures\\n\\nAnemia\\n\\nDecreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility\\n\\nDamage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures\\n\\nDecreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection\\n\\nPericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium)\\n\\nPregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus\\n\\nIrreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring
